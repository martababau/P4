          This object was used as a kitchen utensil. It consists of a small
          glass bottle that screws onto a metal tube with a small hole,
          connected to a kind of pump that disperses the product gently
          throughout the food when squeezed. It can be used with different types
          of sauces and condiments, as long as they have a liquid texture, so
          that it can be sprayed well over the meal. It was a very useful
          utensil in the kitchen of our ancestors.
