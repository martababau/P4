        This object was used as a kitchen utensil. It consists of a small
        glass bottle that screws onto a metal tube with a small hole,
        connected to a kind of pump that disperses the product gently
        throughout the food when squeezed. It can be used with different types
        of sauces and condiments, as long as they have a liquid texture, so
        that it can be sprayed well over the meal. It was a very useful
        utensil in the kitchen of our ancestors.

        consists of a main rod and has a metal skeleton, which allows it to be
        opened and closed. We believe it has been used for several generations
        to transport various objects and purchases, as it has a rod with a
        handle that is easy and comfortable to hold. This object also has a
        somewhat waterproof fabric, which we think is nylon or polyester, that
        prevents liquid spills during transport.
