      <p>
        Paper Holders were small, simple devices used to hold sheets of paper together. Typically made from a single piece of bent metal wire, they are shaped into loops to securely grip thing materials/objects. Paper Holders are designed to be easily attached and removed without damaging the materials they were holding. Despite their simplicity, they are highly effective for organizing papers and were commonly found in various sizes and colors.

        somewhat waterproof fabric, which we think is nylon or polyester, that
        prevents liquid spills during transport.Paragraph 1 This object has a very simple silhouette. The keeper is a support that
