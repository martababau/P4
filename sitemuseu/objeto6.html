        This object was designed to provide illumination to areas. It features a plastic handle encased in metal wires, designed to hold a small candle inside. The handle includes a hole, allowing it to be tied to various locations and hang in a room without special attachments. Despite its rudimentary design, it served its purpose well, as humans had no other means of lighting up spaces back then.

      <p id="wikihow">Paragraph 1 This object has a very simple silhouette. The keeper is a support that
        consists of a main rod and has a metal skeleton, which allows it to be
        opened and closed. We believe it has been used for several generations
        to transport various objects and purchases, as it has a rod with a
        handle that is easy and comfortable to hold. This object also has a
        somewhat waterproof fabric, which we think is nylon or polyester, that
        prevents liquid spills during transport.
