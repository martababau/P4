          This object has a very simple silhouette. The keeper is a support that
          consists of a main rod and has a metal skeleton, which allows it to be
          opened and closed. We believe it has been used for several generations
          to transport various objects and purchases, as it has a rod with a
          handle that is easy and comfortable to hold. This object also has a
          somewhat waterproof fabric, which we think is nylon or polyester, that
          prevents liquid spills during transport.
