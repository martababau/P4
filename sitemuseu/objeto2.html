        <p>
          Strokers were an artistic tool highly valued by our ancestors. They
          are made up of some metals, having a very shiny appearance and each
          one of these objects has a unique shape, which allows us to create
          different patterns and finishes with the use of paint. To use it, you
          have to hold each stroker by the flat end with a hole and the shape of
          the other end has a pattern to create art; We can see the results of
          strokers in various abstract archaic works.
