      <p>
        Strokers were an artistic tool highly valued by our ancestors. They
        are made up of some metals, having a very shiny appearance and each
        one of these objects has a unique shape, which allows us to create
        different patterns and finishes with the use of paint. To use it, you
        have to hold each stroker by the flat end with a hole and the shape of
        the other end has a pattern to create art; We can see the results of
        strokers in various abstract archaic works.
