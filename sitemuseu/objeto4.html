          On display we also have a rare form of ancient trade, swappers. They
          were discovered inside a glass jar; they have a round shape and are
          composed by materials such as plastic and ceramic; After some research
          we discovered that these objects were an important currency for our
          ancestors and varied in size, color and design, thus their market
          value depended on these factors; Although we have some of these in our
          exhibit, we found more types of swappers that are yet to be analyzed.
